Understanding Vector Databases

A vector database is a specialized type of database designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vectors efficiently. These vectors are numerical representations of data, such as text, images, or audio, created through embedding models.

Key Concepts:

Embeddings: Machine learning models convert unstructured data (like text) into fixed-length vectors of numbers. Similar content produces similar vectors.

Vector Similarity: Vector databases use mathematical operations like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance to find similar vectors quickly.

Popular Vector Databases:

1. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): An open-source library optimized for similarity search, great for local development.

2. Pinecone: A fully managed vector database service with excellent scalability.

3. Weaviate: An open-source vector database with built-in vectorization.

4. Milvus: Open-source vector database designed for scalability and high performance.

5. Chroma: Simple, open-source embedding database perfect for prototyping.

How Vector Databases Work in RAG:

1. Indexing Phase: Documents are converted to embeddings and stored in the vector database.

2. Query Phase: User questions are also converted to embeddings.

3. Similarity Search: The database finds the most similar document embeddings to the query embedding.

4. Retrieval: The top-k most similar documents are returned to augment the LLM prompt.

Vector databases are essential for building modern AI applications, enabling semantic search capabilities that go beyond simple keyword matching.
