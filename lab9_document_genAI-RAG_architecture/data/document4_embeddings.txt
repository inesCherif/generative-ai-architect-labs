Text Embeddings: Converting Words to Numbers

Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. They allow computers to understand that "king" is related to "queen" and "royal" even though the words are different.

What Are Embeddings?

An embedding is a vector (a list of numbers) that represents a piece of text. For example:

- "dog" might be: [0.2, 0.8, -0.3, 0.5, ...]
- "puppy" might be: [0.25, 0.82, -0.28, 0.48, ...] (very similar!)
- "car" might be: [-0.6, 0.1, 0.9, -0.2, ...] (very different)

Popular Embedding Models:

1. OpenAI Embeddings:
   - text-embedding-ada-002: Current standard, 1536 dimensions
   - High quality, requires API calls

2. Sentence Transformers:
   - all-MiniLM-L6-v2: Fast and lightweight (384 dimensions)
   - all-mpnet-base-v2: More accurate (768 dimensions)
   - Can run locally without API calls

3. Hugging Face Models:
   - Various models for different languages and domains
   - Open source and customizable

How Embeddings Enable Semantic Search:

Traditional keyword search looks for exact word matches. Embedding-based search understands meaning:

Query: "What is machine learning?"

- Traditional: Finds documents with words "machine" and "learning"
- Semantic: Finds documents about AI, neural networks, algorithms (related concepts!)

Creating Embeddings for RAG:

1. Choose an embedding model
2. Process your documents through the model
3. Store the resulting vectors in a vector database
4. When a query comes in, embed it with the same model
5. Find the most similar document vectors
6. Return those documents to augment the LLM

Embedding Dimensions:

- Higher dimensions (1536): More information, better accuracy, more storage
- Lower dimensions (384): Faster, less storage, still effective for most use cases

The key principle: Similar meanings produce similar vectors, enabling powerful semantic search capabilities in RAG systems.
