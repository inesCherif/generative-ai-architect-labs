Large Language Models (LLMs) Explained

Large Language Models are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. They form the foundation of modern conversational AI and text generation applications.

Popular LLMs:

1. OpenAI GPT Series:
   - GPT-3.5: Fast and cost-effective for most applications
   - GPT-4: More capable, better reasoning, multimodal (text and images)
   - GPT-4 Turbo: Optimized for speed and lower costs

2. Anthropic Claude:
   - Claude 3 Opus: Most capable model
   - Claude 3 Sonnet: Balanced performance and speed
   - Claude 3 Haiku: Fastest, most compact

3. Open Source Models:
   - Llama 2 (Meta): Free for research and commercial use
   - Mistral: High-performance open models
   - Falcon: Efficient and powerful

How LLMs Work:

- Training: Models learn patterns from billions of text examples.
- Tokenization: Text is broken into smaller units (tokens) for processing.
- Context Window: The amount of text the model can consider at once (e.g., 4K, 8K, 32K tokens).
- Generation: Models predict the next most likely token, creating coherent text.

LLM Limitations:

- Knowledge Cutoff: Training data has a cutoff date, so models lack recent information.
- Hallucinations: Models may generate plausible but incorrect information.
- No Real Understanding: LLMs pattern-match; they don't truly "understand" content.
- Context Limits: Can only process a limited amount of text at once.

This is why RAG is so important - it addresses many of these limitations by providing current, verifiable information from external sources.
