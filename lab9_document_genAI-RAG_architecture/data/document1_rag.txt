What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is an AI framework that combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. Instead of relying solely on the information learned during training, RAG systems can access and incorporate relevant information from a knowledge base in real-time.

How RAG Works:

1. Query Processing: When a user asks a question, the system first processes and understands the query.

2. Document Retrieval: The system searches through a database of documents to find the most relevant information related to the query. This is typically done using vector similarity search.

3. Context Augmentation: The retrieved documents are combined with the original query to create an enriched context.

4. Response Generation: A large language model uses both the query and the retrieved context to generate an accurate, grounded response.

Benefits of RAG:

- Reduced Hallucinations: By grounding responses in actual documents, RAG reduces the AI's tendency to make up information.
- Up-to-date Information: RAG can access current information without requiring model retraining.
- Source Attribution: Responses can cite specific documents, increasing transparency.
- Domain Specialization: RAG allows AI systems to become experts in specific domains by accessing specialized knowledge bases.

RAG is particularly useful for customer support, question-answering systems, research assistance, and any application requiring factual accuracy and verifiable sources.
