## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Interactive Mode (Recommended for beginners)

```bash
# Start the interactive builder
python tools/interactive_builder.py
```

This will guide you through:

1. Choosing a use case
2. Designing architecture
3. Creating execution plan
4. Building pitch deck

### Option 2: Manual Mode

1. Define your use case: `use_cases/use_case_template.md`
2. Design architecture: Use draw.io or Mermaid
3. Create execution plan: `execution_plan/execution_plan_template.md`
4. Build pitch: `pitch/pitch_deck.md`

## 💡 What Makes This Different from Lab 7?

**Lab 7:** You built a working system (hands-on coding)
**Lab 8:** You design a system (architecture & planning)

This lab teaches you:

- How to plan BEFORE building
- How to communicate technical designs
- How to get buy-in from stakeholders
- How to manage AI projects

## 🎓 Skills You'll Gain

- ✅ System architecture design
- ✅ Technical diagramming
- ✅ Project planning
- ✅ Risk assessment
- ✅ Executive communication
- ✅ ROI calculation
- ✅ Stakeholder management

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

| Task                  | Time           | Difficulty       |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Choose use case       | 15 min         | Easy             |
| Design architecture   | 45 min         | Medium           |
| Create execution plan | 30 min         | Medium           |
| Build pitch deck      | 30 min         | Medium           |
| Practice presentation | 20 min         | Easy             |
| **TOTAL**             | **~2.5 hours** | **Intermediate** |

## 🎯 Success Criteria
