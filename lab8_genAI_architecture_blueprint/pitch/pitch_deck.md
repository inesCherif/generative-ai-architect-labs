## 🎤 Speaking Notes Template

For each slide, write what you'll actually say.

### Slide 1 Speaking Notes:

```markdown
## Slide 1: The Problem

"Thank you for your time today. I want to start with a problem that's
costing us real money and creating real risk.

[CLICK to show slide]

Our legal team is currently spending over 20 hours every week reviewing
contracts. Let me put that in perspective - that's half of one person's
entire work week, just reviewing contracts.

Now here's what that actually costs us: at $150 per hour, that's $900
per contract in labor costs alone. We're doing about 200 contracts a
year, so that's $180,000 in review costs annually.

But here's what keeps me up at night: even with all that time and money,
we're still missing things. Our analysis shows we're catching about 75%
of compliance issues. That means 1 in 4 problems slips through.

And as we grow - especially if we pursue M&A opportunities - this simply
doesn't scale. We can't hire our way out of this problem.

[Pause]

So what's the solution?"
```

### Slide 2 Speaking Notes:

```markdown
## Slide 2: The Vision

"Let me show you what this could look like.

[CLICK to show slide]

Imagine: a lawyer opens a new contract, drags it into our system, and
gets a comprehensive analysis in 5 minutes.

Not a summary - an actual analysis. Every clause is read, every risk
is flagged, every issue is explained. The lawyer gets an annotated
contract showing exactly what to review, plus an executive summary.

It's like having a senior lawyer do the first pass on every contract,
instantly, with perfect consistency.

The lawyer still reviews and makes the final decision - we're not
replacing human judgment. We're making lawyers superhuman.

And this isn't science fiction. The technology exists today. Let me
show you how it works."
```

### Slide 3 Speaking Notes:

```markdown
## Slide 3: How It Works

"I'll keep the technical details simple, but here's what's happening
under the hood.

[CLICK to show slide]

We have three key components working together:

First, a document analyzer powered by the same AI technology as ChatGPT,
but specialized for legal documents. It can read and understand contracts
just like a human lawyer, but in seconds instead of hours.

Second, a knowledge base containing all our legal policies and compliance
requirements. Think of it like a library that the AI can instantly search.

Third, a risk engine that compares what's in the contract against our
policies and flags anything that doesn't match.

The flow is simple: contract comes in, AI reads it, checks it against
our policies, flags issues, creates a report.

What makes this powerful is the combination - the AI's reading ability
plus our institutional knowledge, working at machine speed.

Now let me show you what this means for our business."
```

### Slide 4 Speaking Notes:

```markdown
## Slide 4: Business Value

"Let's talk about the actual business impact, because this is significant.

[CLICK to show slide]

On efficiency: we're reducing review time from 5 hours to 30 minutes.
That's a 90% time savings. Practically, that means we go from reviewing
4 contracts a week to 20 contracts a week per lawyer.

On cost: we're saving $600 per contract. At 200 contracts a year,
that's $120,000 in annual savings.

On quality: we're improving from 75% to 95% risk detection, and we're
scanning 100% of clauses instead of the 75% we typically catch manually.

Now, return on investment: the total cost is $110,000 to build and run
for year one. We save $120,000 annually. That means we're ROI positive
in just 6 months.

But beyond the numbers, this gives us the capacity to pursue M&A
opportunities we simply can't handle today. That's strategic value
that's hard to quantify.

So what's the path to get this built?"
```

### Slide 5 Speaking Notes:

```markdown
## Slide 5: Timeline & Next Steps

"Here's our 8-week path to launch.

[CLICK to show slide]

Weeks 1-2, we build a prototype using 100 sample contracts. This lets
us validate accuracy and get initial lawyer feedback. This is our
proof-of-concept checkpoint.

Weeks 3-4, we refine based on feedback and build the web interface.

Weeks 5-6, we run a beta test with 5 lawyers processing real contracts.
This is our quality gate.

Weeks 7-8, we roll out to the full team with training and support.

To make this happen, we need four things:
Budget approval for $110,000
Two engineers dedicated to the project
Access to past contracts for training
And about 2-3 hours a week from 5 lawyers for testing

In return, you get a working system in 8 weeks, 5x more review capacity,
$120K in annual savings, and a scalable platform for growth.

The next step is simple: approve the budget, and we start Week 1.
We'll have a prototype to evaluate in just two weeks.

[Pause]

I'm happy to answer any questions."
